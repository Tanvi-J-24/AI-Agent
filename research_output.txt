Sharks are a group of elasmobranch cartilaginous fishes characterized by a ribless endoskeleton, dermal denticles, five to seven gill slits on each side, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. There are more than 530 living species of sharks, taxonomically grouped into 14–30 families. Several larger species can be dangerous to humans. Sharks can rouse fear and awe like no other creature in the sea, and they come in an incredible range of shapes and sizes. Sharks are closely related to skates and rays.
